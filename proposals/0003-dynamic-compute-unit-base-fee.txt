## Summary

Original implementation of Solana had a dynamic governor that
targeted blocks to be at 50% load. The governor was signature based,
and was designed without compute units in mind.  As SVM matured
compute units were added to track load instead of signatures, and
priority fees were added for prioritizing transaction scheduling.
The dynamic signature based governor was removed, and right now the
network has no mechanism to try to target a specific load.

The motivation for a 50% target load is two fold.  One is that at
100% the heterogeneous hardware on the network doesn't perform
uniformly.  This causes downstream issues with leaders delaying and
missing their blocks, and overall performance degradation. Secondly,
stuffing the ledger with full blocks without a fee is an attack on
the verifiability of the ledger by 3rd parties. For example, a faulty
majority of the validators start creating continuous full blocks
while paying minimal base fees and zero priority fees.

## Specification

### Compute Unit Target

Maximum block limit is defined as part of the solana validator
client.  Currently it is at 48 million compute units.  The block
target is 50% of the maximum, which is 24 million compute units.
This target may be updated with a minor version mainnet release
followed by a feature activation.

### Governor

If the average compute units for the last 8 blocks > 50%, base fee
goes up by 12.5%.  If the average compute units for the last 8
blocks < 50%, base fee drops by 50%.

Lowest possible fee = 1000 lamports / 200_000 compute units.

There is no maximum fee, see [###Votes].

### Votes

Votes are not exempt. Validators should start censoring to maintain
load < 50% that includes votes and non votes after fees reach some
critical point.

Motivation for making votes pay the same exact base fee as other
transactions is to prevent a faulty majority from stuffing the
ledger with maximum votes.
